# Survey160 Interview: React

You're in charge of development for a web dashboard that displays a list of users and devices and allows you to select them for no particular reason. You are tasked with improving the code for the Users and Devices display boxes (this knowledge test). You are also told that in the near future there will be more boxes added with different data to be displayed.

### Your assignment:
 1. Refactor the `Interview` component. Create as many files, components as you deem necessary. Keep in mind these 3 principals while making your changes: reusability of components, separation of responabilities, and common React patterns. 

 2. Add a counter to the header of each box that displays the number of selected items. It can be placed anywere on the header. Each box must have it's own counter independent from the other. The counter must update each time an item is selected or deselected. Once again, keep the 3 principals in mind! 

 > Note: This test is for your React skills. Styles and clean CSS are great if you think you've aced the refactor but it won't make up for the React portion.
